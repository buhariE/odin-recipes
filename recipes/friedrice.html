    <h2>Nigerian Fried Rice.</h2>
    <p>This is a foolproof recipe for cooking Jollof rice, West Africa's most popular dish.
    <br>I like to serve it as a side with my West African-style grilled beef (Suya), but it can also be a main course.</p>

    <h3>Ingridients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken Stock</li>
        <li>Peppers (scotched bonnets/Habanero, fresno chili)</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Red Bell papers</li>
        <li>Spices (salt, chicken bouillon thyme, curry powder, paprika, cumin, tumeric)</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>Rice</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. 
            <br>Add onion and salt and saut√© until onion starts to soften, 4 to 5 minutes. Clear space in the middle of the pan, 
            <br>add chicken stock. 
            <br>Season with paprika, curry powder, cumin, thyme, pepper, and turmeric; 
            <br>continue cooking for 1 to 2 minutes until everything is well combined.
        </li>
        <li>
            Turn off the heat, and stir in the rice, making sure every grain of rice is coated with the oil-chicken stock mixture. 
            <br>Add bay leaf and chicken bouillon paste.
        </li>
        <li>
            Turn heat to high, stir in chicken stock sauce, and bring to a vigorous simmer. 
            <br>Cover with a tight fitting lid, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 20 minutes. Do not remove the lid or stir rice.
        </li>
        <li>
            Turn off heat after 20 minutes, and set the timer for 12 minutes. Allow rice to sit and do not remove the lid.
        </li>
        <li>
            After the 12 minutes are up, remove lid, and fluff rice with a fork, separating all the grains. Serve garnished with green onions and chopped cilantro.
