    <h2>Potato Salad.</h2>
    <p>This is a foolproof recipe for cooking Jollof rice, West Africa's most popular dish.
    <br>I like to serve it as a side with my West African-style grilled beef (Suya), but it can also be a main course.</p>

    <h3>Ingridients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 white potatoes</li>
        <li>1 sweet potato</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>
            2 stalks celery, chopped
        </li>
        <li>
            ½ onion, chopped
        </li>
        <li>
            ¾ cup mayonnaise
        </li>
        <li>
            1 tablespoon prepared mustard
        </li>
        <li>
            1 ½ teaspoons ground black pepper
        </li>
        <li>
            1 teaspoon salt
        </li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add white potatoes and sweet potato; 
            <br>cook in boiling water until a knife is easily inserted into the centers, about 30
            <br>minutes. Drain, cool, peel, and chop potatoes into bite-sized pieces.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil. Cover,
            <br>remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water until fully hard cooked, 10 to
            <br>12 minutes. Remove from hot water; cool, peel, and chop into bite-sized pieces
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine potatoes, eggs, celery, and onion in a large serving bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            Whisk together mayonnaise, mustard, pepper, and salt in a small bowl until well combined. Add to potato mixture and stir to coat. Refrigerate and serve chilled.
        </li>
    </ol>
